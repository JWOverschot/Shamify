# Shamify
### Knock-off Spotify
I didn't like the default Spotify application so I build my own

# ðŸš¨ Important ðŸš¨
### âš  Do not distribute this app. It's intended for personal use only âš 
Everything is handled client side, so your Spotify **client id** and **client secret** are packaged with your application
